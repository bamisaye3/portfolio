<h4 class="pt-4" id="intro">Introduction</h4>
<p>The RMS Titanic popularly known as Titanic, one of the most infamous maritime disaster in 
history was a British passenger liner, it was the largest ship in the world at the time measuring 
270m in length and 28m in width.  <br>
In 1912 it began it maiden voyage with over 2200 passenger and crew, on April 15th the titanic 
struck an iceberg on it starboard (right) which led to significant damage to the ship and eventual 
sinking that led to the loss of over 1500 lives. This data attempt to analyze factors that influence 
survival if any, and the chances of survival of the different passenger aboard the ship. <br>
This data was sourced from Kaggle and a big credit to vinicius150987 who made it dataset 
available. You can find a copy of the dataset here. <br>
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinicius150987/titanic3">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinicius150987/titanic3 </a> </p>


<h4 class="py-3" id="">Objective</h4>
The objective of this analysis is to attempt to analyze factors that influence survival if any, and 
the chances of survival of the different passenger aboard the ship.



  
<h4 class="py-3" id="cleaning">Data Cleaning & Transformation</h4>
As usual every data must be cleaned and transformed before being analyzed, to do that, I used 
power Query for my data cleaning.  
<ol>
<li class="px-3"> 
	Verified and ensure all relevant columns to be used in the analysis contain the right data 
	type and those with the wrong type were duly converted to the appropriate type </li>
<li class="px-3">
	Created Age groups: For the analysis, I will love to see survival rate in relation to the age 
of the passengers aboard the ship. This is to ascertain if there is a correlation between 
passengers age and chances of survival, I therefore created 3 age groups those between 0 
and 17years were grouped as 0-17years, then young adults as 18-59years and elderly as 
60 and above.
</li>  
<li class="px-3">
Replaced values and removed columns: It was observed that the age column contained a 
number of blank cells â€“ to handle this, we could either leave as blank and analyze it or 
use the median or mean to replace all the missing values. I chose to replace the missing 
values with the median which turned out to be 29. Also note that the missing values was 
about 20% of the total rows available which is within the acceptable range of less than 
30% 
</li>
<li class="px-3"> Removed Columns: Columns with more than 30% missing values were automatically 
removed as they are not fit for analysis, also other columns not used within our analysis 
were removed - these columns are Ticket, Fare, Home Destination, Port of Embarkment 
</li>
</ol>


<h4 id="analysis" class="pt-4">MODELLING, ANALYSIS (FINDINGS) AND VISUALIZATION </h4>
<p>The data was analyzed using Pivot Tables and visualized using pivot charts and below are some of my findings </p>
<ol class="mb-3">
<li class="px-3"> Passenger: of the 1309 passengers recorded, 843 were male and 466 were female  </li>
<li class="px-3"> Survivors: of the 1309 passengers 500 of them survived. Giving a survival rate of 38%. </li>
<li class="px-3"> Distribution of Survivors by gender:  of the 466 females aboard the ship a whooping 
339 survived, this amounts to 73% of the female population surviving. For the male 
gender only 161 of the 843 survived giving a survival rate of 19%

<p class="fw-bold">
FINDINGS: Despite having less female aboard the ship, more of them survived as 
compared with the male </p></li>
<li class="px-3"> Comparing survivors by gender: 
Trying to dig deeper into the survivor data by gender, we found that of the total 500 
survivors, 339 female amounts to 68% of the total survivors and the male amounts to 32%

<p class="fw-bold">
FINDINGS: we found that of every 100 survivors, about 68 of them were female, this 
obviously is not just a random occurrence considering there were more male aboard and 
the male are stronger, this only point to a more structured approached to evacuation of the 
passengers and this approach tilted slightly towards favouring female survivors.
</p>




<li class="px-3">Analysis by passenger class: The ship has 3 different classes denoted by 1,2 and 3 in the 
dataset each of them implying First class, Middle Class and Lower Class respectively.

<p class="fw-bold">
From the analysis, 62% of those with First Class tickets survived, the rate dropped to 
43% for those in middle class and only 26% of those in the lower class survived.<br>
VERDICT: The class of ticket played a huge role in the survival of passengers, seems 
those with higher status, were able to secure necessary requirements that ensured their 
survival.</p></li>

</tbody></table>

With it already being established that passenger class played a role in the survival of the 
passengers, a further check showed even among each class, the gender also played a role. 
For those with first class ticket, only 5 of the 144 females onboard did not survive 
implying 97% survival rate for female in the first class cabin. The same cannot be said 
for the male gender, as a drastic drop was recorded with only 34% surviving (61 out of 
179). The same trend holds true for those in the middle class, 89% of women survived 
with only 15% of the men survived and finally in the lower class 49% of the female 
survived while just 15% survived.  
<p class="fw-bold"> 
VERDICT: with the consistency across board, this cannot be a random occurrence, it can 
be said that even amongst the different passenger classes, conscious effort was made to 
ensure more female survivors </p>

</li>



<li class="px-3">Survival by Age Groups: For this analysis, the passengers were grouped into 3 age 
categories. Age 0-17 were grouped as 0-17years, age 18-59, as 18-59years and those 
above 60 as 60 and above.

</tbody></table>
A total of 154 passengers were aged between 0 and 17years, 53% of this population 
survived, 407 of the 1115 people were between 18 and 59years which amounts to 37% 
survival rate for this age group, and for the elderly (60 and above), only 30% of them 
survived. 
<p class="fw-bold">VERDICT: there seem to have been conscious effort to ensure more children survived, 
followed by the working population (18-59years)</p></li>

<div class="" id="challenges">
<h4 class="pt-5">Challenges</h4>
<p>Quite a number of challenges were encountered during while analyzing this data, while in reality 
there were over 2200 passengers aboard the titanic, this dataset only records details of 1309 
passengers.</p>

<p> Missing values, some of the columns were completely removed as too many rows were missing 
from those columns, some others were also removed as they played no significant role in the 
analysis. </p>

<p>The age column used in the analysis contained some blank cells, we used the median age of 28 to 
replace all the missing values. Also note that the missing values was about 20% of the total rows 
available which is within the acceptable range of less than 30%</p> 
</div>


<h4 class="pt-4" id="summary">Summary</h4>

<p>From our analysis, through the pandemonium and crisis occurring, there were conscious effort 
by the captain and crew of the ship to ensure priority were given to children and young adults, 
we also found out that class of ticket played a major role in survival of passengers, finally, the 
female were also prioritized over men during the evacuation process.</p>
